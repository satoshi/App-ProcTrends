App-ProcTrends-Cron

App::ProcTrends is a set of libraries to track cpu / memory usage per process.
We have plenty of software out there that measures system-level cpu / memory
usage.  However we lack metrics at process level granularity.

This application comprises of 3 components:
1. cron script that essentially runs ps every minute
2. command-line script that generates text-based data in tables, as well as
graphs from RRD files
3. RESTful webservice that can list individual and aggregated graphs
